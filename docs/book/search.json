    "text": "3.1 Template\nThe A2SIT app generates customised templates for each country. To download the template, select your country from the dropdown menu, then click the “Download country template” button.\n\nThe dropdown menu contains all the countries currently supported by the app1.\nThe next step is to fill in the template with your data. Opening the template, you will find that it has three tabs:\n\nIntro: instructions on how to fill in the template\nData: this is where you enter your indicator data\nStructure: this defines the structure of the index\n\nThe first tab is simply information and is ignored by the A2SIT app. We will also walk through the compilation of the spreadsheet here. Importantly, do not change the names of the Data and Structure tabs: these are tab names expected by the app.\n\n3.1.1 Data\nThe data tab contains a table which looks something like this:\n\nIn this table (excluding the metadata rows/columns), each row represents one Admin 2 region, and each column is one indicator.\nThe admin2Pcode column has the main codes used by the app, and this is automatically filled in depending on the country you have selected. These codes must not be edited because they are used to generate the maps later on in the app. The Name column has the corresponding name of each region. These names may be edited if you wish, although it is recommended not to edit them unless they contain spelling errors etc.\nThe next columns to the right are the data columns: this is where you should paste your indicator data. The number of columns here will depend on how many indicators you have. You can expand the table as far as you want. Consider some important rules though:\n\nAll indicator data must be numerical. You cannot enter words like “yes”/“no”, or categories such as “XL”, “L”, etc. The app only understands numerical indicator data. Also data that looks numerical, like “10 million” will not work: it should be 10000000!\nEach indicator data column should be accompanied by the metadata cells above it (name, group, direction, etc). Copy these cells as far as necessary. Do not leave metadata cells with no indicator data below them (delete these if this happens).\nTry to fill in data for every Admin2 code. Admin2 codes with no indicator data will be deleted by the app.\nDo not input data for rows where there are no Admin2 codes.\nMake sure each indicator has at least some data available. Indicators with no data can still be input into the app, but they will be automatically removed.\n\nThe best way to see what the correctly-formatted input data looks like is to simply download the example data set.\nThe row immediately above the indicator data contains the indicator code. These should be short unique codes which identify the indicator. Ideally these should be about 8 characters long or less, have no spaces, and should start with a letter (not a number). Examples could be “GDPpc”, “Migrants”, “Gini”. These will be used in some plots in the app, so it will help you if they are descriptive.\nThe next row above is the indicator name. These can be longer indicator names which will also be displayed in the app. Examples can be “GDP per capita”, “Gini coefficient” and so on.\nThe row above the indicator name is the group to which the indicator belongs in the level immediately above it. This defines the structure of the index and is explained in detail in the Structure section below.\nThe direction row defines the direction of each indicator. An indicator that shares the same “direction” as the index should have a “1” - such indicators in the context of Severity could be rates of domestic violence, or the number of displaced people. Higher values of these indicators imply higher severity. On the other hand, indicators such as coverage of public services, number of hospitals, etc run in the opposite direction: higher values imply less severity, therefore they should be assigned a direction of “-1”. The direction row can only take values of -1 or 1.\nFinally, the initial weight row gives a weight for each indicator. It is recommended to leave these all at “1” (representing equal weighting) unless you have good reasons for doing otherwise. The weights are used in the aggregation step later in the app to calculate the index scores, and can be used to increase or decrease the contribution of each indicator. However, weighting can be complex and highly subjective. If you do wish to adjust weights, consider that weights are relative within each aggregation group: they will be rescaled to sum to 1 within each group by the app. In other words, if we have three indicators in a group with weights 1, 1, and 1, they will each get a weight of 1/3.\n\n\n3.1.2 Structure"
