# Welcome  {.unnumbered}

This is the detailed documentation of the Admin2 Severity Index Tool (A2SIT), which was developed by the UNCHR.

The aim of this documentation is to explain in detail:

* How to use the app
* The methodology behind the A2SIT
* Technical details to help maintain and expand the app

## What is the A2SIT app?

The A2SIT app is a browser-based app which aims to measure "Severity" at the Admin-2 level, in order to help direct community-based protection interventions. It takes a set of user-input data and uses it to build a composite indicator of severity, as well as providing a detailed analysis of the data.

*Peter maybe add some more info about the context here, or in the next chapter?*

## Using the app

The app is hosted online [here](https://rstudio.unhcr.org/SeverityIndex/). To begin using the app, you have to download the input data template, or download the example data set.

The app includes plenty of in-app guidance and hints, but the full documentation is found in this online book - in particular go to @sec-layout to learn about the app layout, and @sec-datainput to learn how to upload your data.

As the app is wrapped in an R package, it is also possible to install and run it locally: this is explained more in @sec-techimp.

## Limitations

The app gives quite a lot of flexibility in that any indicator set can be used, and the structure of the index can be edited by the user. Within the app, there are also some methodological options such as the aggregation method.

However, the app is set up to take Admin-2 level data. This is for the purposes of being able to map the indicators, so your data must:

- Be from a single country
- Be at the Admin-2 level

In other words, it is not currently possible to analyse international data. However, this can be done with the [COINr package](https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINr/index.html), upon which the app is based, if you are comfortable working in R.

On the methodological side, consider that composite indicators are an imprecise science, and they are built using a number of assumptions, and most likely an incomplete data set due to data limitations. A composite indicator should not be viewed as a precise measure, rather as a an *indication* of the concept you are trying to measure. You should always investigate the raw data as well as the composite index scores, to find out *why* a given region scores high or low. The A2SIT app is designed to help in this respect, allowing to drill down for any given region.
