f_plot_map(coin, iCode, ISO3, as_discrete = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coin}{The coin}

\item{iCode}{iCode of indicator/aggregate to plot}

\item{ISO3}{Country of the data to plot}

\item{as_discrete}{If \code{TRUE}, plots severity categories.}

\description{
Uses leaflet and stored geometry files to plot any selected indicator or
aggregate as a choropleth map, for a selected country.
}
\details{
This function relies on geometry files that are stored inside the A2SIT package.
It will therefore not work if the country selected by \code{ISO3} does not have
available geometry.

To see which countries currently have available geometry, run: \code{\link[=get_cached_countries]{get_cached_countries()}}.

The function merges the selected indicator with the geometry file, using the
uCodes. At this point in the app, it should have been checked that the user's
uCodes correspond exactly with those in the geometry file.

To change colours and styling, look in the source code of this function.
