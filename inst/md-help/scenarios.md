The Scenarios tab compares the scenarios (which are accessible through the Results tab) against each other.

#### Table

The "Compare scenarios" table displays by default the ranks of each region at the index level, for each scenario. The global search box allows to search for specific regions. 

Clicking the "gear" icon in the top right of the box opens more table options. First, you can either use ranks or scores as the basis of the comparison. The "How to compare" dropdown then specifies whether simply to show the values (of the ranks/scores), or to show (absolute) differences. To explain this: selecting "Absolute differences", while comparing using ranks, will take the absolute rank difference between each scenario and the "Base" scenario (the first scenario column in the table). This identifies which regions have changed the most in terms of ranks, between each scenario.

Selecting the "base scenario" simply changes which scenario is the first (leftmost) in the table. This is only relevant when differences or absolute differences are selected as the mode of comparison.

Note that typically, ranks are a much more robust way to compare scenarios, since scores are dimensionless and the range and magnitude of scores can change dramatically based on the aggregation approach.

#### Scatter

The scatter plot gives an alternative way to compare two scenarios. Use the "gear" icon to select which scenarios to plot on the x and y axis, and whether to compare using ranks or scores. The scatter plot is a useful complement to the table, in that it shows at a glance the spread between two scenarios. Hovering over points shows the name of each region.
