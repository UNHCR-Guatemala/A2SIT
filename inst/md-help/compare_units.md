The Compare Regions tab allows to compare two regions against each other.

#### What to do

Simply select the two regions to compare using the dropdown menus at the top of the page, and whether to compare using ranks, scores, or severity category. The table updates accordingly.

The table automatically highlights, for each row, the region which has the highest score (i.e. the most severe). The filters and search tools in the table allow to filter to specific index levels, sort by ranks and scores, and search for specific indicators.
