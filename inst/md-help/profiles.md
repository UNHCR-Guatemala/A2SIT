The profiles page presents the data of a selected Admin2 region in more detail.
The objective here is to go back to the underlying data and to see *why* a
given region may score high or low.

#### What to do

This tab is mostly informative. Click on the "select a region" dropdown menu to select a region. This will generate a number of outputs based on the selected region which you can explore.

#### Details table

This table shows the rank, score, and severity category for the selected region, for the index and every aggregate measure down to the indicator level. The table is sorted by default from the highest level (index) downwards. Use the filter boxes to filter levels or to search for specific indicators. The table is colour formatted to highlight higher scores.

#### Dimensions

The dimensions box shows the scores and ranks of indicators/aggregates within aggregation groups and compares to the overall medians. Use the "gear" icon in the top right of the box to toggle between a radar chart or table, and to select which group to display. Note that for groups with less than three indicators, the radar chart cannot be displayed.

#### Highest/lowest indicators

The last two boxes display the top and bottom-ranking five indicators for the selected unit. This can help to show in which indicators the selected region has unusually high or low values.
